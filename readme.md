## ‚ú® Features

This project is designed to accelerate your data-driven hackathon solutions with a suite of powerful capabilities:

*   ‚ú® **Rapid Data Extraction:** Quickly gather data from various sources (APIs, web scraping, files) using pre-built or easily adaptable scripts.
*   üîç **Automated Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Streamline the data preparation pipeline, ensuring high-quality, usable datasets for immediate analysis.
*   üìà **Insightful Analysis Tools:** Leverage the power of Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration, statistical analysis, and compelling data visualizations.
*   üöÄ **Modular & Extensible Architecture:** Easily adapt and expand data collection and analysis modules to tackle diverse hackathon challenges and datasets.
*   ‚ö° **Quick Setup & Deployment:** Get up and running swiftly with minimal configuration, allowing you to focus on problem-solving.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the `hackathon_data_collection_analysis` project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
*   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TempGaurab/hackathon_data_collection_analysis.git
    cd hackathon_data_collection_analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary Python packages. While a `requirements.txt` is not explicitly listed in the structure, we'll assume common data science libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    Once dependencies are installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook to access the project's analysis and data collection scripts.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This command will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the Jupyter interface.


## üöÄ Usage Examples

This project is primarily designed to be interacted with via Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts within the `extract_data` directory.

### 1. Running Data Extraction Scripts

Navigate to the `extract_data` directory to find scripts for collecting data. You can run these from your terminal.

```bash
# Navigate to the data extraction directory
cd extract_data

# Example: Run a hypothetical Python script for API data collection
# Replace 'your_extraction_script.py' with the actual script name (e.g., api_collector.py)
python your_extraction_script.py

# After running, collected data might be saved in a 'data/' directory (if implemented)
# Go back to the root directory to open Jupyter Notebooks
cd ..
```

### 2. Performing Data Analysis in Jupyter

Once you've collected data, open a Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `analysis.ipynb` if one exists, or create a new one) to begin your analysis.

```python
# Inside a Jupyter Notebook cell

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load your extracted data (assuming it's saved in a 'data/' directory)
try:
    df = pd.read_csv("data/extracted_data.csv") # Adjust path if your data is elsewhere
    print("Data loaded successfully! First 5 rows:")
    print(df.head())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: 'data/extracted_data.csv' not found. Please ensure you've run your extraction scripts.")
    # Create a dummy DataFrame for demonstration if no file is found
    data = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'], 'Value': [10,
